# diabetes-analysis
I completed this analysis as a personal project to strengthen my data analytics skills in SAS and to explore how cause-specific death rate for cancer has changed from 2014 to 2021 within different states.

I used four datasets for this analysis,

-Weekly Provisional Counts of Death by State and Select Causes, 2020-2022

-Weekly Counts of Death by State and Select Causes, 2014-2019

-United States Census Bureau. Annual Population Estimates, Estimated Components of Resident Population Change, and Rates of the Components of Resident Population Change for the United States, States, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2020 to July 1, 2021

-Population, Population Change, and Estimated Components of Population Change: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2019
